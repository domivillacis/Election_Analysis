# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

I am participating in an election audit for the Colorado Board of Elections where I've been asked to help Tom with the results of a US Congressional precinct in Colorado.
Part of my analysis is reporting the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes each candidate received, the percentage each candidate won, and the winner of the elections based on the popular vote.

For this analysis and to automate the process, I used the Python programming language, which through codes helped me find the data and results I was looking for. Also, another powerful tool I used is VSC Visual Studio Code, which is where I wrote my codes and it allows me to print the results to my command line and to the txt.file I created for this project.

The following are the results that we are going to obtain from this analysis:
1. The total number of votes cast
2. A list with the names of the candidates who participated in the elections
3. The total number of votes each candidate received
4. The percentage of votes each candidate won
5. And he winner of the election based on the popular vote

Let's start!
